**Endpoints to Add**:
```python
# Add new client endpoint
@app.route("/add_client", methods=["POST"])
@login_required
def add_client():
    # Your implementation here
    pass

# Serve static files (CSS, JS, images)
@app.route('/static/<path:filename>')
def static_files(filename):
    # Your implementation here
    pass
```

## Step 9: Test Your Frontend
